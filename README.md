# FRAM-PSO: A Semi-Quantitative Framework for Sustainability and Optimization

This repository contains the data and models for the manuscript titled: "A Semi-Quantitative Framework for Integrating Sustainability and Optimization into Systemic Risk Assessment using FRAM-PSO."

## Overview

This project provides a computational framework for integrating the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to perform sustainability-driven risk assessment. The FRAM models for all three case studies are provided.

## Repository Structure

- **`/FRAM_Models/`**: This directory contains the `.xfmv` files for the three case studies. These models can be viewed and edited using the FRAM Model Visualizer (FMV).
  - `case_study_1.xfmv`
  - `case_study_2.xfmv`
  - `case_study_3.xfmv`
- **`LICENSE`**: The MIT License for this project.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## How to Use This Repository

### Viewing the FRAM Models

The `.xfmv` models in the `/FRAM_Models/` directory can be visualized using the free, web-based FRAM Model Visualizer (FMV).

1.  Go to https://functionalresonance.github.io/FMV_Community_Edition/
2.  Download the `.xfmv` file for the case study you wish to view from this repository.
3.  On the FMV website, upload the downloaded `.xfmv` file. You will then have access to the full FRAM model structure.
